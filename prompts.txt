Create a song by outputting a list of notes. This song should fit the theme: happy. Output the song in a series of notes strictly, and insert a dash with the time in seconds the note should be afterwards. Make sure there is variance in the times per note for added complexity. For an example format (the song should be much longer than this): C0-1 E1-4 G#0-2 A1-2

Complete this process for a bass, guitar, piano, and drums part such that when the parts are combined, the song sounds cohesive and harmonious. Make sure to include the instrument before each list of notes, separated with a colon. 

Here is a short example, your song should be longer: 

Guitar:
E4-1 G4-0.5 C4-1 E4-0.5 G4-1 C5-0.5 E4-1 G4-0.5 C4-1 E4-0.5 G4-1 C5-0.5

Piano:
C4-1 E4-0.5 G4-1 E4-0.5 C4-1 E4-0.5 G4-1 E4-0.5 C4-1 E4-0.5 G4-1 E4-0.5

Bass:
C3-2 G2-1 A2-1 G2-0.5 C3-2 G2-1 A2-1 G2-0.5
