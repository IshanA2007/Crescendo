# ðŸŽµ Crescendo ðŸŽµ
A little personal project to make some groovy tunes!

Crescendo is a web-application that allows a user to input any sound they want and receive a personalized soundtrack that can be sang to or enjoyed in some other way! One day I watched Charlie Puth make an entire song from just a spoon and a glass and I thought wow, I want to do that too. But then, I realized I have no music skill whatsoever, so instead I decided to use my programming skills and AI to do it for me! 

## ðŸ¥… Goals

- Require only 1 sound (e.g clap, snap, etc.) as input
- Produce a complete melody using only that one sound
- Support different styles/moods of music (pop, rock, rap, happy, sad)


## ðŸš€ Milestones:

5/31/2023 - Determined which AI model to use


*This is a work in progress!*

Start date: 5/22/2023
