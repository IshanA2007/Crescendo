# ðŸŽµ Crescendo ðŸŽµ
A massive group project to make some groovy tunes!

Crescendo is a web-application that allows a user to input any sound they want and receive a personalized soundtrack that can be sang to or enjoyed in some other way! One day, our team (of 2) was watching Charlie Puth making an entire song from just a spoon and a glass and we thought wow, we want to do that too. But then, we realized we have no music skill whatsoever, so instead we decided to use our programming skills and AI to do it for us! 

## ðŸ¥… Goals

- Require only 1 sound (e.g clap, snap, etc.) as input
- Produce a complete melody using only that one sound
- Support different styles/moods of music (pop, rock, spooky tense suspense rap, happy, sad, elevator)


## ðŸš€ Milestones:

5/31/2023 - Determined which AI model to use
6/2/2023 - Finished audio manipulation processes


*This is a work in progress!*

Start date: 5/22/2023
