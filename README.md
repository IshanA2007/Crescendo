# ðŸŽµ Crescendo ðŸŽµ
A little personal project to make some groovy tunes!

Crescendo is a user-friendly and innovative web-application that allows users to generate personalized soundtracks by inputting any desired audio. This technology promotes creative expression through dynamic music creation and enjoyment. The idea for this application was inspired by a memorable instance where Charlie Puth composed a whole song using unconventional musical instruments. However, recognizing my own limited musical abilities, I opted for a technological solution and used my programming and AI expertise to pioneer Crescendo.

## ðŸ¥… Goals

- Require only 1 sound (e.g clap, snap, etc.) as input
- Produce a complete melody using only that one sound
- Support different styles/moods of music (pop, rock, rap, happy, sad)
